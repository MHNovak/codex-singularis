# codex-singularis
Codex Singularis (CS) is a tool to create army lists for Warhammer 40k and other tabletop strategy games. It is meant to look and feel similar to the BattleScribe app and is compatible with the same data and roster files, yet runs in the browser without downloads or configuration. 

You can give it a try at https://codexsingularis.com 

## Data Files 

Gamesystem and army catalogue data are organized and maintained by the community at [BSData](https://github.com/bsdata), where you can find raw data files.

To avoid duplication, only a small sample of (outdated) data is included in this repo under `assets/data/`. The [live CS site](https://codexsingularis.com) has up to date data for a larger collection of game systems to explore.
